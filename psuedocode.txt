Psuedocode for main
    arduinos send init
    program grabs board numbers and button counts (is button count necessary?)

    arduino sends button down
    program compares buttonID to map of note/tuning values
    check for free channels (iterate over)
    if there is a channel free, then play that note on that channel (storing buttonID for later check)
        (if there isn't a channel free, don't play the note)
            (note class and channel class?)

    arduino sends button up
    program checks channels for the same button down
    if note exists (currently pressed), send note off and note the freed channel


Tuning files
    list of MIDI notes/PB values
    convert existing tuning file (cents) to MIDI/PB map on launch (args input)
